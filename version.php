/**
 * VERSIONING RULES (For Developers / AI Tooling):
 * This plugin uses Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
 * 
 * - MAJOR (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0): 
 *   Use for deep architectural changes, replacing frameworks, or formally 
 *   dropping compatibility with older Moodle versions.
 *
 * - MINOR (e.g., 1.4.0 -> 1.5.0): 
 *   Use for new features, new settings in the Moodle form (e.g., completion conditions), 
 *   or structural database updates (XMLDB).
 *
 * - PATCH (e.g., 1.4.0 -> 1.4.1): 
 *   Use strictly for bugfixes, language string corrections, minor CSS tweaks, 
 *   or anything that carries zero architectural risk.
 *
 * EVERY release must be officially block-documented in CHANGELOG.md!
